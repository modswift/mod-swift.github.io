A feature of Apache 2 known to few is
[mod_dbd](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_dbd.html).
Using that you can configure a SQL database connection within the 
[Apache.conf](https://github.com/AlwaysRightInstitute/mod_swift/blob/master/apache.conf#L79)
and use that within all your Apache modules/handlers.

Though you can also write your own, Apache 2 comes with drivers for 
[SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org), 
[PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org),
MySQL and Oracle.
The macOS system Apache and the one than can be tapped in Homebrew
includes SQLite3.
On Linux you can easily install the ones you want:

    sudo apt-get install libaprutil1-dbd-sqlite3 \
                         libaprutil1-dbd-pgsql

Your Swift Apache module doesn't need to concern itself with the database type
or connection, it can just ask Apache for a connection and it'll happily
return one from its pool.
The code looks like this:

    guard let con = req.dbdAcquire()                 else { return ... }
    guard let res = con.select("SELECT * FROM pets") else { return ... }
    
    while let row = res.next() {
      req.puts("<li>\(row[0])</li>")
    }

So how does Apache know how to connect and all that? As everything in Apache,
the admin can configure that in the apache.conf:

    <IfModule dbd_module>
      DBDriver  sqlite3
      DBDParams "/var/data/testdb.sqlite3"
    </IfModule>

Or to access your favorite OpenGroupware.org database using PostgreSQL:

    <IfModule dbd_module>
      DBDriver pgsql
      DBDParams "host=127.0.0.1 port=5432 dbname=OGo user=OGo password=OGo"

      # Connection Pool Management
      DBDMin      1
      DBDKeep     2
      DBDMax     10
      DBDExptime 60
    </IfModule>

You get the idea. We provide a simple wrapper for the select query shown as
part of our 
[mods_baredemo](https://github.com/AlwaysRightInstitute/mod_swift/blob/master/mods_baredemo/Sources/DatabaseAPI.swift).
It is still very simplistic though you can access all the mod_dbd API as
demoed by that wrapper.

It is funny what stuff Apache can do, right? And all that in a little clumsy
but very modular way.
With **mod_swift** we can reduce the clumsyness and potentially come up with
something quite neat.
